What this directory is for:
    
	-This directory contains tools for building and running proofs without haveing to type them directly into the prover itself.
    -All the main tools generate executable intermediary scripts that you can run that will provide input to the prover or to the translator

What this directory contains:

README:
    The file you are currently reading.

randomproof.sh:
    Runs the appropriate scripts in order to build a random argument and run it against the prover
    Use this if you just want to see the prover in action

translator:
    Translates user input formulas into heredocs which are runnable on the prover
    Use this if you have something in particular you want to prove

hereDocGenerator.lisp:
    Generates herdocs which can be run against the translator.

prettyPrint.lisp:
    An ancillary script which can build and print a nicely formatted random argument.

common.lisp:
    Common functions and variables between the two lisp scripts above.

translator.cpp:
    The source for the translator program.

output_heredoc.txt:
    The heredoc generated by the translator, running this will run a proof on the prover program in the parent directory

transfile.txt:
    The heredoc generated by the randomproof.sh file (by proxy via the heredoc lisp script) this can be run on the translator
    both of those last two are mainly intermediate files.


translator-runner-filter.sh:
    uses egrep to clean up some of the nonessential output from the translator, it is better to use this via
    rlwrap-wrapper.sh

rlwrap-wrapper.sh:
    a convenience wrapper for writing and running simple arguments against the prover, calls translator-runner-filter.sh
    this is probably the best choice for writing proofs by hand
